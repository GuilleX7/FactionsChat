# FactionsChat
 FactionsChat is a very lightweight Bukkit chat plugin for Factions
 
## Features

- Support for ally and faction chat
- Customizable messages and channel format
- Very lightweight

## Compiling and building

This project uses Maven for building. However, some dependencies (Factions plugin...) have to be supplied manually because I wasn't able to find any active repository for them. Those are:

- Factions.jar
- MassiveCore.jar

Which can be found and downloaded here: https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/factions3-for-1-13.63602/

After that, just type  `mvn install` in the root folder
